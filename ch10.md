## 10.1 Unix I/O

A Linux file is a sequence of m bytes. All I/O devices, such as networks, disks, and terminals, are modeled as files, and all input and output is performed by reading and writing the appropriate files. This elegant mapping of devices to files allows the Linux kernel to export a simple, low-level application interface, known as Unix I/O, that enables all input and output to be performed in a uniform and consistent way:

* *Opening files*. An application announces its intention to access an I/O device by asking the kernel to open the corresponding file. The kernel returns a small nonnegative integer, called a *descriptor*, that identifies the file in all subsequent operations on the file. The kernel keeps track of all information about the open file. 

  The application only keeps track of the descriptor. Each process created by a Linux shell begins life with three open files: *standard input* (descriptor 0), *standard output* (descriptor 1), and *standard error* (descriptor 2). The header file `<unistd.h>` defines constants `STDIN_ FILENO`, `STDOUT_FILENO`, and `STDERR_FILENO`, which can be used instead of the explicit descriptor values.

* *Changing the current file position*. The kernel maintains a file position `k`, initially `0`, for each open file. The file position is a byte offset from the beginning of a file. An application can set the current file position `k` explicitly by performing a `seek` operation.

* *Reading and writing files*. A read operation copies `n > 0` bytes from a file to memory, starting at the current file position `k` and then incrementing `k` by `n`. Given a file with a size of `m` bytes, performing a read operation when `k ≥ m` triggers a condition known as *end-of-file (EOF)*, which can be detected by the application. There is no explicit “EOF character” at the end of a file. 

  Similarly, a write operation copies `n > 0` bytes from memory to a file, starting at the current file position `k` and then updating `k`.

* *Closing files*. When an application has finished accessing a file, it informs the kernel by asking it to *close* the file. The kernel responds by freeing the data structures it created when the file was opened and restoring the descriptor to a pool of available descriptors. When a process terminates for any reason, the kernel closes all open files and frees their memory resources.

## 10.2 Files

Each Linux file has a *type* that indicates its role in the system:

* A regular file contains arbitrary data. Application programs often distinguish between *text files*, which are regular files that contain only ASCII or Unicode characters, and *binary files*, which are everything else. To the kernel there is no difference between text and binary files. 

  A Linux text file consists of a sequence of *text lines*, where each line is a sequence of characters terminated by a *newline* character (‘\n’). The newline character is the same as the ASCII line feed character (LF) and has a numeric value of `0x0a`.

* A *directory* is a file consisting of an array of *links*, where each link maps a *filename* to a file, which may be another directory. Each directory contains at least two entries: `.` (dot) is a link to the directory itself, and `..` (dot-dot) is a link to the parent directory in the directory hierarchy (see below). You can create a directory with the `mkdir` command, view its contents with ls, and delete it with `rmdir`.

* A *socket* is a file that is used to communicate with another process across a network (**Section 11.4**).

## 10.5 Robust Reading and Writing with the `Rio` Package

这里解释一下为什么 `rio_readlineb` 是 thread-safe 的，其余的函数同理。这里先阅读 p939 页的 Aside，可以知道 Steven 版本的是因为 static 的 buffer 而 not thread-safe 的。

`rio_readlineb` 的 buffer 是跟着 `rio_t` 走的，调用了 `rio_read` ，

``` c
static ssize_t rio_read(rio_t *rp, char *usrbuf, size_t n)
{
  int cnt;

  while (rp->rio_cnt <= 0) { /* Refill if buf is empty */
    rp->rio_cnt = read(rp->rio_fd, rp->rio_buf,
                       sizeof(rp->rio_buf));
    if (rp->rio_cnt < 0) {
      if (errno != EINTR) /* Interrupted by sig handler return */
        return -1;
    }
    else if (rp->rio_cnt == 0) /* EOF */
      return 0;
    else
      rp->rio_bufptr = rp->rio_buf; /* Reset buffer ptr */
  }

  /* Copy min(n, rp->rio_cnt) bytes from internal buf to user buf */
  cnt = n;
  if (rp->rio_cnt < n)
    cnt = rp->rio_cnt;
  memcpy(usrbuf, rp->rio_bufptr, cnt);
  rp->rio_bufptr += cnt;
  rp->rio_cnt -= cnt;
  return cnt;
}
```

这里其实只有 `read` 是线程安全的，具体可以阅读 `man 2 read`：在linux 3.14后，`read `便可以说是线程安全的了

``` 
Among the APIs subsequently listed are read() and readv(2). And among the effects that should be atomic across threads (and processes) are updates of the file offset. However, before Linux 3.14, this was not the case: if two processes that share an open file description (see open(2)) perform a read() (or readv(2)) at the same time, then the I/O operations were not atomic  with  respect updating the file offset, with the result that the reads in the two processes might (incorrectly) overlap in the blocks of data that they obtained. This problem was fixed in Linux 3.14.
```

由此，虽然文中没有给出thread-safe的示例代码，但是显然 `rp` 不是线程安全的，这个结构体必然是 thread-specific 的。而这样一来一切都 make sense 了，`rio_t` 解决线程安全的本质是给每个线程创建一个带有 buffer 和 cnt 的结构体。这种情况下，`rio_readlineb` 的线程安全也就很自然了。
