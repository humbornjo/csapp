    "By assembling a number of logic gates into a network, we can construct computa-\n",
    "tional blocks known as combinational circuits. Several restrictions are placed on\n",
    "how the networks are constructed:\n",
    "* Every logic gate input must be connected to exactly one of the following:\n",
    "(1) one of the system inputs (known as a primary input), (2) the output\n",
    "connection of some memory element, or (3) the output of some logic gate.\n",
    "* The outputs of two or more logic gates cannot be connected together. Oth-\n",
    "erwise, the two could try to drive the wire toward different voltages, possibly\n",
    "causing an invalid voltage or a circuit malfunction.\n",

    "* Since a combinational circuit consists of a series of logic gates, it has the\n",

    "change accordingly. By contrast, a C expression is only evaluated when it is\n",
    "encountered during the execution of a program.\n",
    "* Logical expressions in C allow arguments to be arbitrary integers, interpreting\n",
    "0 as false and anything else as true. In contrast, our logic gates only operate\n",
    "over the bit values 0 and 1.\n",
    "* Logical expressions in C have the property that they might only be partially\n",
    "evaluated. If the outcome of an and or or operation can be determined by just\n",
    "evaluating the first argument, then the second argument will not be evaluated.\n",
    "For example, with the C expression\n",
    "$(a && !a) && func(b,c)$\n",
    "the function func will not be called, because the expression (a && !a) evalu-\n",
    "ates to 0. In contrast, combinational logic does not have any partial evaluation\n",
