    "* The _program counter_ (commonly referred to as the PC, and called $%rip$ in x86-64) indicates the address in memory of the next instruction to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The integer _register file_ contains 16 named locations storing 64-bit values. These registers can hold addresses (corresponding to C pointers) or integer data. Some registers are used to keep track of critical parts of the program state, while others are used to hold temporary data, such as the arguments and local variables of a procedure, as well as the value to be returned by a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The condition code registers hold status information about the most recently executed arithmetic or logical instruction. These are used to implement con- ditional changes in the control or data flow, such as is required to implement `if` and `while` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A set of vector registers can each hold one or more integer or floating-point values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program memory contains the executable machine code for the program, some information required by the operating system, a run-time stack for managing procedure calls and returns, and blocks of memory allocated by the user (e.g., by using the malloc library function).\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, the program memory is addressed using virtual addresses. At any given time, only limited subranges of virtual addresses are considered valid. For example, x86-64 virtual addresses are represented by 64-bit words. In current implementations of these machines, the upper $16$ bits must be set to zero, and so an address can potentially specify a byte over a range of $2^{48}$, or $64$ terabytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single machine instruction performs only a very elementary operation. For example, it might add two numbers stored in registers, transfer data between memory and a register, or conditionally branch to a new instruction address. The compiler must generate sequences of such instructions to implement program constructs such as arithmetic expression evaluation, loops, or procedure calls and returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several features about machine code and its disassembled representation are worth noting:\n",
    "\n",
    "* x86-64 instructions can range in length from 1 to 15 bytes. The instruction encoding is designed so that commonly used instructions and those with fewer operands require a smaller number of bytes than do less common ones or ones with more operands.\n",
    "* The instruction format is designed in such a way that from a given starting position, there is a unique decoding of the bytes into machine instructions. For example, only the instruction pushq %rbx can start with byte value 53.\n",
    "* The disassembler determines the assembly code based purely on the byte sequences in the machine-code file. It does not require access to the source or assembly-code versions of the program.\n",
    "* The disassembler uses a slightly different naming convention for the instructions than does the assembly code generated by gcc. In our example, it has omitted the suffix ‘q’ from many of the instructions. These suffixes are size designators and can be omitted in most cases. Conversely, the disassembler adds the suffix ‘q’ to the call and ret instructions. Again, these suffixes can safely be omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating the actual executable code requires running a linker on the set of object-code files, one of which must contain a function main. Suppose in file main.c we had the follo"

    "most assembly-code instructions gener- ated by gcc have a single-character suffix denoting the size of the operand. For example, the data movement instruction has four variants: movb (move byte), movw (move word), movl (move double word), and movq (move quad word). The suffix ‘l’ is used for double words, since 32-bit quantities are considered to be “long words.” The assembly code uses the suffix ‘l’ to denote a 4-byte integer as well as an 8-byte double-precision floating-point number. This causes no ambigu- ity, since floating-point code involves an entirely different set of instructions and registers."
