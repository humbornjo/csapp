    "* _Execute._ In the execute stage, the arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) either performs the operation specified by the instruction (according to the value of **ifun**). We refer to the resulting value as **valE**. The condition codes are possibly set. For a conditional move instruction, the stage will evaluate the condition codes and move condition (given by ifun) and **enable the updating of the destination register only if the condition holds**. Similarly, for a jump instruction, it determines whether or not the branch should be taken.\n",

    "Our implementation of SEQ consists of **combinational logic** and two forms of memory devices: **clocked registers** (the program counter and condition code register) and **random access memories** (the register file, the instruction memory, and the data memory). **Combinational logic does not require any sequencing** or control—values propagate through a network of logic gates whenever the inputs change.As we have described, we also assume that **reading from a random access memory operates much like combinational logic**, with the output word generated based on the address input. Since our **instruction memory** is only used to read instructions, we can therefore treat this unit as if it were combinational logic.\n",

    "We are left with just four hardware units that require an explicit control over their sequencing—the **program counter**, the one **condition code register**, the **data memory**, and the **register file**. These are controlled via a single clock signal that triggers the loading of new values into the registers and the writing of values to the random access memories. The program counter is loaded with a new instruction address every clock cycle. The condition code register is loaded only when an integer operation instruction is executed. The data memory is written only when an rmmovq, pushq, or call instruction is executed. The two write ports of the register file allow two program registers to be updated on every cycle, but we can use the special register ID 0xF as a port address to indicate that no write should be performed for this port.\n",

    "This clocking of the registers and memories is all that is required to control the\n",

    "This approach would violate the principle stated above. It would require reading\n",
