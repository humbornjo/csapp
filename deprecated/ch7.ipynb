During this scan, the linker maintains a set $E$ of relocatable object files that will be merged to form the executable, a set $U$ of unresolved symbols (i.e., symbols referred to but not yet defined), and a set $D$ of symbols that have been defined in previous input files. Initially, $E$, $U$ , and $D$ are empty.\n",

The linker then assigns run-time memory addresses to the **new aggregate sections**, to **each section** defined by the input modules, and to **each symbol** defined by the input modules. When this step is complete, each instruction and global variable in the program has a unique run-time memory address.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _Relocating symbol references within sections._ In this step, the linker modifies **every symbol reference** in the bodies of the code and data sections so that they point to the correct run-time addresses. To perform this step, the linker relies on data structures in the relocatable object modules known as relocation entries, which we describe next.\n",

    "### 7.7.1 Relocation Entries\n",
    "When an assembler generates an object module, it does not know where the code\n",
    "and data will ultimately be stored in memory. Nor does it know the locations of\n",
    "any externally defined functions or global variables that are referenced by the\n",

The `addend` is a signed constant that is used by some types of relocations to bias the value of the modified reference.\n",

    "\n",
    "* `R_X86_64_PC32`. Relocate a reference that uses a 32-bit PC-relative address. Recall from Section 3.6.3 that a PC-relative address is an offset from the current run-time value of the program counter (PC). When the CPU executes an instruction using PC-relative addressing, it forms the effective address (e.g., the target of the call instruction) by adding the 32-bit value encoded in the instruction to the current run-time value of the PC, which is always the address of the next instruction in memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "These two relocation types support the x86-64 small code model, which assumes that the total size of the code and data in the executable object file is smaller than 2 GB, and thus can be accessed at run-time using 32-bit PC-relative addresses. The small code model is the default for gcc. Programs larger than 2 GB can be compiled using the `-mcmodel=medium` (medium code model) and `-mcmodel=large` (large code model) flags\n",

Second, a single copy of the `.text` section of a shared library in memory can be shared by different running processes. \n",

    "The basic idea is to do some of the linking statically when the executable file is created, and then complete the linking process dynamically when the program is loaded. It is important to realize that none of the code or data sections from `libvector.so` are actually copied into the executable prog2l at this point. Instead, the linker copies some relocation and symbol table information that will allow references to code and data in `libvector.so` to be resolved at load time.\n",

    "When the loader loads and runs the executable `prog2l`, it loads the partially\n",
