    "The event might be directly related to the execution of the current instruction.\n",
    "For example, a virtual memory page fault occurs, an arithmetic overflow occurs,\n",
    "or an instruction attempts a divide by zero. On the other hand, the event might be\n",
    "unrelated to the execution of the current instruction. For example, a system timer\n",

    "an indirect procedure call (the exception), through a jump table called an _exception table_, to an operating system subroutine (the _exception handler_) that is specifically designed to process this particular kind of event.

Other numbers are assigned by the designers of the operating system _kernel_ (**the memory-resident part of the operating system**). Examples of the former include divide by zero, page faults, memory access violations, breakpoints, and arithmetic overflows. Examples of the latter include system calls and signals from external I/O devices.\n",

    "\n",
    "![](asset/ch8/3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At run time (when the system is executing some program), the processor detects that an event has occurred and determines the corresponding exception number $k$.

    "* The processor also pushes some additional processor state onto the stack that will be necessary to restart the interrupted program when the handler returns. For example, an x86-64 system pushes the EFLAGS register containing the current condition codes, among other things, onto the stack.\n",

    "### 8.1.2 Classes of Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be divided into four classes: _interrupts, traps, faults, and aborts_. The table in **Figure 8.4** summarizes the attributes of these classes.\n",

    "![](asset/ch8/4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interrupts** \n",
    "\n",
    "_Interrupts_ occur _asynchronously_ as a result of signals from I/O devices that are external to the processor. Hardware interrupts are asynchronous in the sense that they are not caused by the execution of any particular instruction. Exception handlers for hardware interrupts are often called _interrupt handlers_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 8.5** summarizes the processing for an interrupt. I/O devices such as network adapters, disk controllers, and timer chips trigger interrupts by signaling a pin on the processor chip and placing onto the system bus the exception number that identifies the device that caused the interrupt.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](asset/ch8/5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traps and System Calls**\n",
    "\n",
    "_Traps_ are _intentional_ exceptions that occur as a result of executing an instruction. Like interrupt handlers, trap handlers return control to the next instruction. The most important use of traps is to provide a procedure-like interface between user programs and the kernel, known as a _system call_.\n",
    "\n",
    "User programs often need to request services from the kernel such as reading a file (`read`), creating a new process (`fork`), loading a new program (`execve`), and terminating the current process (`exit`). To allow controlled access to such kernel services, processors provide a special syscall `n` instruction that user programs can execute when they want to request service `n`. Executing the _syscall_ instruction causes a trap to an exception handler that decodes the argument and calls the appropriate kernel routine. **Figure 8.6** summarizes the processing for a system call.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](asset/ch8/6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From a programmer’s perspective, a system call is identical to a regular function call. However, their implementations are quite different. Regular functions run in _user mode_, which restricts the types of instructions they can execute, and they access the same stack as the calling function. A system call runs in _kernel mode_, which allows it to execute privileged instructions and access a stack defined in the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Faults**\n",
    "\n",
    "Faults result from error conditions that a handler might be able to correct. When a fault occurs, the processor transfers control to the fault handler. If the handler is able to correct the error condition, it returns control to the faulting instruction, thereby re-executing it. Otherwise, the handler returns to an `abort` routine in the kernel that terminates the application program that caused the fault. **Figure 8.7** summarizes the processing for a fault.\n",

    "**Aborts**\n",

Our program appears to have exclusive use of both the processor and the memory. The processor appears to execute the instructions in our program, one after the other, without interruption. Finally, the code and data of our program appear to be the only objects in the system’s memory. These illusions are provided to us by the notion of a process.\n",

    "Consider a system that runs three processes, as shown in Figure 8.12. The single physical control flow of the processor is partitioned into three logical flows, one for each process. Each vertical line represents a portion of the logical flow for a process. In the example, the execution of the three logical flows is interleaved. Process A runs for a while, followed by B, which runs to completion. Process C then runs for a while, followed by A, which runs to completion. Finally, C is able to run to completion.\n",

    "flow is called a _time slice_. Thus, multitasking is also referred to as _time slicing_.\n",
    "\n",
    "If two flows overlap in time, then they are concurrent, even if they are running on the same processor. However, we will sometimes find it useful to identify a proper subset of concurrent flows known as _parallel flows_. If two flows are running concurrently on different processor cores or computers, then we say that they are _parallel flows_, that they are _running in parallel_, and have _parallel execution_.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 8.2.4 User and Kernel Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the operating system kernel to provide an airtight process abstraction, the processor must provide a mechanism that restricts the instructions that an application can execute, as well as the portions of the address space that it can access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processors typically provide this capability with a _mode bit_ in some control register that characterizes the privileges that the process currently enjoys. When the mode bit is set, the process is running in _kernel mode_ (sometimes called _supervisor mode_). A process running in kernel mode can execute any instruction in the instruction set and access any memory location in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the mode bit is not set, the process is running in _user mode_. A process in user mode is not allowed to execute _privileged instructions_ that do things such as halt the processor, change the mode bit, or initiate an I/O operation. Nor is it allowed to directly reference code or data in the kernel area of the address space. Any such attempt results in a fatal protection fault. **User programs must instead access kernel code and data indirectly via the system call interface**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A process running application code is initially in user mode. **The only way for the process to change from user mode to kernel mode is via an exception such as an interrupt, a fault, or a trapping system call.** When the exception occurs, and control passes to the exception handler, the processor changes the mode from user mode to kernel mode. The handler runs in kernel mode. When it returns to the application code, the processor changes the mode from kernel mode back to user mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linux provides a clever mechanism, called the `/proc` filesystem, that allows user mode processes to access the contents of kernel data structures**. The `/proc` filesystem exports the contents of many kernel data structures as a hierarchy of text files that can be read by user programs. For example, you can use the /proc filesystem to find out general system attributes such as CPU type (`/proc/cpuinfo`), or the memory segments used by a particular process (`/proc/process-id/maps`). The 2.6 version of the Linux kernel introduced a `/sys` filesystem, which exports additional low-level information about system buses and devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.2.5 Context Switches\n",
    "\n",
    "The operating system kernel implements multitasking using a higher-level form of exceptional control flow known as a _context switch_. The context switch mechanism is built on top of the lower-level exception mechanism that we discussed in **Section 8.1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel maintains a context for each process. The context is the state that the kernel needs to restart a preempted process. It consists of the values of objects such as the \n",
    "* general-purpose registers,\n",
    "* the floating-point registers,\n",
    "* the program counter,\n",
    "* user’s stack,\n",
    "* status registers,\n",
    "* kernel’s stack,\n",
    "* and various kernel data structures such as a page table that characterizes the address space,\n",
    "* a process table that contains information about the current process,\n",
    "* and a file table that contains information about the files that the process has opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "At certain points during the execution of a process, the kernel can decide to preempt the current process and restart a previously preempted process. This decision is known as _scheduling_ and is handled by code in the kernel, called the _scheduler_.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the kernel selects a new process to run, we say that the kernel has scheduled that process. After the kernel has scheduled a new process to run, it preempts the current process and transfers control to the new process using a mechanism called a context switch that \n",
    "1. saves the context of the current process,\n",
    "2. restores the saved context of some previously preempted process, and\n",
    "3. passes control to this newly restored process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A context switch can occur while the kernel is executing a system call on behalf of the user. If the system call blocks because it is waiting for some event to occur, then the kernel can put the current process to sleep and switch to another process. For example, if a read system call requires a disk access, the kernel can opt to perform a context switch and run another process instead of waiting for the data to arrive from the disk. Another example is the sleep system call, which is an explicit request to put the calling process to sleep. **In general, even if a system call does not block, the kernel can decide to perform a context switch rather than return control to the calling process.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A context switch can also occur as a result of an interrupt. For example, all systems have some mechanism for generating periodic timer interrupts, typically every 1 ms or 10 ms. Each time a timer interrupt occurs, the kernel can decide that the current process has run long enough and switch to a new process.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Figure 8.14__ shows an example of context switching between a pair of processes A and B. In this example, initially process A is running in user mode until it traps to the kernel by executing a `read` system call. The trap handler in the kernel requests a DMA transfer from the disk controller and arranges for the disk to interrupt the processor after the disk controller has finished transferring the data from disk to memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disk will take a relatively long time to fetch the data (on the order of tens of milliseconds), so instead of waiting and doing nothing in the interim, the kernel performs a context switch from process A to B. Note that, before the switch, the kernel is executing instructions in user mode on behalf of process A (i.e., **there is no separate kernel process**). During the first part of the switch, the kernel is executing instructions in kernel mode on behalf of process A. Then at some point it begins executing instructions (still in kernel mode) on behalf of process B. And after the switch, the kernel is executing instructions in user mode on behalf of process B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process B then runs for a while in user mode until the disk sends an interrupt to signal that data have been transferred from disk to memory. The kernel decides that process B has run long enough and performs a context switch from process B to A, returning control in process A to the instruction immediately following the read system call. Process A continues to run until the next exception occurs, and so on."

(A signal is a form of software interrupt that we will describe in detail in Section 8.5.)\n",

    "When a process terminates for any reason, the kernel does not remove it from the system immediately. Instead, the process is kept around in a terminated state until it is _reaped_ by its parent. When the parent reaps the terminated child, the kernel passes the child’s exit status to the parent and then discards the terminated process, at which point it ceases to exist. A terminated process that has not yet been reaped is called a _zombie_.\n",

The `init` process, which has a PID of 1, is created by the kernel during system start-up, never terminates, and is the ancestor of every process. If a parent process terminates without reaping its zombie children, then the kernel arranges for the `init` process to reap them. However, long-running programs such as shells or servers should always reap their zombie children. Even though zombies are not running, they still consume system memory resources.\n",

If a process in the wait set has already terminated at the time of the call, then `waitpid` returns immediately. In either case, `waitpid` returns the PID of the terminated child that caused `waitpid` to return.

    "\n",
    "In line 15, the parent waits for all of its children to terminate by using `waitpid` as the test condition of a while loop. Because the first argument is −1, the call to `waitpid` blocks until an arbitrary child has terminated. As each child terminates, the call to `waitpid` returns with the nonzero PID of that child. Line 16 checks the exit status of the child. If the child terminated normally in this case, by calling the `exit` function—then the parent extracts the exit status and prints it on `stdout`.\n",

The global variable environ points to the first of these pointers, `envp[0]`.

    "## 8.5 Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "A signal is a small message that notifies a process that an event of some type has occurred in the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each signal type corresponds to some kind of system event. Low-level hardware exceptions are processed by the kernel’s exception handlers and would not normally be visible to user processes. Signals provide a mechanism for exposing the occurrence of such exceptions to user processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](asset/ch8/15.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.5.1 Signal Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "The transfer of a signal to a destination process occurs in two distinct steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Sending a signal._ **The kernel sends (delivers) a signal to a destination process by updating some state in the context of the destination process**. The signal is delivered for one of two reasons: (1) The kernel has detected a system event such as a divide-by-zero error or the termination of a child process. (2) A process has invoked the kill function (discussed in the next section) to explicitly request the kernel to send a signal to the destination process. A process can send a signal to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Receiving a signal._ A destination process receives a signal when it is forced by the kernel to react in some way to the delivery of the signal. The process can either ignore the signal, terminate, or catch the signal by executing a user-level function called a signal handler. **Figure 8.27** shows the basic idea of a handler catching a signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](asset/ch8/14.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A signal that has been sent but not yet received is called a _pending signal_. **At any point in time, there can be at most one pending signal of a particular type. If a process has a pending signal of type `k`, then any subsequent signals of type k sent to that process are not queued; they are simply discarded.** A process can selectively block the receipt of certain signals. When a signal is blocked, it can be delivered, but the resulting pending signal will not be received until the process unblocks the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pending signal is received at most once. For each process, the kernel maintains the set of pending signals in the `pending` bit vector, and the set of blocked signals in the `blocked` bit vector.1 The kernel sets bit `k` in pending whenever a signal of type `k` is delivered and clears bit `k` in pending whenever a signal of type `k` is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.5.2 Sending Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix systems provide a number of mechanisms for sending signals to processes. All of the mechanisms rely on the notion of a _process group_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process Groups**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every process belongs to exactly one _process group_, which is identified by a positive integer _process group ID_. The `getpgrp` function returns the process group ID of the current process.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, a child process belongs to the same process group as its parent. A process can change the process group of itself or another process by using the `setpgid` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `setpgid` function changes the process group of process `pid` to `pgid`. If `pid` is zero, the PID of the current process is used. If `pgid` is zero, the PID of the process specified by `pid` is used for the process group ID. For example, if process 15213 is the calling process, then\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "setpgid(0, 0);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "creates a new process group whose process group ID is 15213, and adds process 15213 to this new group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sending Signals with the /bin/kill Program**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `/bin/kill` program sends an arbitrary signal to another process.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "linux> /bin/kill -9 15213\n",
    "```\n",

    "A negative PID causes the signal to be sent to every process in process group PID. For example, the command\n",
