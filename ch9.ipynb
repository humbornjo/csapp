    "Virtual memory is an elegant interaction of hardware exceptions, hardware address translation, main memory, disk files, and kernel software that provides each process with a large, uniform, and private address space.\n",
    "\n",
    "With one clean mechanism, virtual memory provides three important capabilities: \n",
    "1. It uses main memory efficiently by treating it as a cache for an address space stored on disk, keeping only the active areas in main memory and transferring data back and forth between disk and memory as needed.\n",
    "2. It simplifies memory management by providing each process with a uniform address space.\n",

    "## 9.1 Physical and Virtual Addressing\n",
    "\n",
    "The main memory of a computer system is organized as an array of M contiguous byte-size cells. Each byte has a unique _physical address_ (PA). The first byte has an address of 0, the next byte an address of 1, the next byte an address of 2, and so on. Given this simple organization, the most natural way for a CPU to access memory would be to use physical addresses. We call this approach _physical addressing_. **Figure 9.1** shows an example of physical addressing in the context of a load instruction that reads the 4-byte word starting at physical address 4. When the CPU executes the load instruction, it generates an effective physical address and passes it to main memory over the **memory bus**. The **main memory** fetches the 4-byte word starting at physical address 4 and returns it to the CPU, which stores it in a register.\n",

    "With virtual addressing, the CPU accesses main memory by generating a _virtual address (VA)_, which is converted to the appropriate physical address before being sent to main memory. The task of converting a virtual address to a physical one is known as _address translation_. Dedicated hardware on the CPU chip called the _memory management unit (MMU)_ translates virtual addresses **on the fly**, using a lookup table stored in main memory whose contents are managed by the operating system.\n",

Similarly, physical memory is partitioned into _physical pages (PPs)_, also $P$ bytes in size. (Physical pages are also referred to as _page frames_.)\n",

    "\n",
    "The replacement policy on misses also assumes greater importance, because the penalty associated with replacing the wrong virtual page is so high. Thus, operating systems use much more sophisticated replacement algorithms for DRAM caches than the hardware does for SRAM caches. Finally, because of the large access time of disk, DRAM caches always use write-back instead of write-through.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.3.2 Page Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any cache, the VM system must have some way to determine if a virtual\n",
    "page is cached somewhere in DRAM. If so, the system must determine which\n",
    "physical page it is cached in. If there is a miss, the system must determine where the virtual page is stored on disk, select a victim page in physical memory,\n",
    "and copy the virtual page from disk to DRAM, replacing the victim page.\n",
    "\n",
    "These capabilities are provided by a combination of operating system soft-\n",

    "each time it converts a virtual address to a physical address. The operating system\n",
    "is responsible for maintaining the contents of the page table and transferring pages\n",
    "back and forth between disk and DRAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 9.4** shows the basic organization of a page table. A page table is an array\n",
    "of _page table entries (PTEs)_. Each page in the virtual address space has a PTE at\n",
    "a fixed offset in the page table. For our purposes, we will assume that each PTE\n",
    "consists of a valid bit and an n-bit address field. The valid bit indicates whether\n",
    "the virtual page is currently cached in DRAM. If the valid bit is set, the address\n",
    "field indicates the start of the corresponding physical page in DRAM where the\n",

Using a technique we will describe in detail in **Section 9.6**, the address translation hardware uses the virtual address as an index to locate PTE 2 and read it from memory. Since the valid bit is set, the address translation hardware knows that VP 2 is cached in memory. So it uses the physical memory address in the PTE (which points to the start of the cached page in PP 1) to construct the physical address of the word.\n",

    "tion hardware reads PTE 3 from memory, infers from the valid bit that VP 3 is\n",

The interesting point is that the loader never actually copies any data from disk into memory.

However, in some instances it is desirable for processes to share code and data. For example, every process must call the same operating system kernel code, and every C program makes calls to routines in the standard C library such as printf. Rather than including separate copies of the kernel and standard C library in each process, the operating system can arrange for multiple processes to share a single copy of this code by mapping the appropriate virtual pages in different processes to the same physical pages.\n",

For example, the code segment, data segment, heap, shared library segment, and user stack are all distinct areas. Each existing virtual page is contained in some area, and any virtual page that is not part of some area does not exist and cannot be referenced by the process. **The notion of an area is important because it allows the virtual address space to have gaps**.

To answer this question, the fault handler searches the list of area structs, comparing A with the `vm_start` and `vm_end` in each area struct. If the instruction is not legal, then the fault handler triggers a segmentation fault, which terminates the process. This situation is labeled “1” in **Figure 9.28**. Because a process can create an arbitrary number of new virtual memory areas (using the `mmap` function described in the next section), a sequential search of the list of area structs might be very costly.

    "protection exception, which terminates the process. This situation is labeled\n",
    "“2” in **Figure 9.28**.\n",
    "3. At this point, the kernel knows that the page fault resulted from a legal operation on a legal virtual address. It handles the fault by selecting a victim page, swapping out the victim page if it is dirty, swapping in the new page, and updating the page table. When the page fault handler returns, the CPU restarts the faulting instruction, which sends A to the MMU again. This time, the MMU translates A normally, without generating a page fault."

    "\n",
    "Linux initializes the contents of a virtual memory area by associating it with an `object` on disk, a process known as `memory mapping`. Areas can be mapped to one of two types of objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Regular file in the Linux file system:_ An area can be mapped to a contiguous section of a regular disk file, such as an executable object file. The file section is divided into page-size pieces, with each piece containing the initial contents of a virtual page. Because of demand paging, none of these virtual pages is actually swapped into physical memory until the CPU first _touches_ the page (i.e., issues a virtual address that falls within that page’s region of the address space). **If the area is larger than the file section, then the area is padded with zeros**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _Anonymous file:_ An area can also be mapped to an anonymous file, created\n",
    "by the kernel, that contains all binary zeros. The first time the CPU touches\n",
    "a virtual page in such an area, the kernel finds an appropriate victim page\n",

However, many processes have identical read-only code areas. For example, each process that runs the Linux shell program bash has the same code area. Further, many programs need to access identical copies of read-only run-time library code. For example, every C program requires functions from the standard C library such as printf. It would be extremely wasteful for each process to keep duplicate copies of these commonly used codes in physical memory. Fortunately, memory mapping provides us with a clean mechanism for controlling how objects are shared by multiple processes.\n",

    "Since each object has a unique filename, the kernel can quickly determine that process 1 has already mapped this object and can point the page table entries in process 2 to the appropriate physical pages.

For each process that maps the private object, the page\n",
