Just for fun :>

## Why jupyter

It can run c kernel, however I found it really inconvenient. Should have use plain markdown.

A true master is an eternal student

1. not fully understand PIC and interpositioning (7.12-7.13)
2. some aids on arch lab compilation - [fail-to-compile-the-y86-simulatur-csapp](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63152352/fail-to-compile-the-y86-simulatur-csapp)
3. cache lab really kills me, random try is all you need.
4. really, I mean, is user supposed to manipulate sig handler except for sigchld? Maybe only if you want to "gracefully and manually exit a coroutine emitted web server", cringe.
